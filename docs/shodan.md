For example, something like: RewriteEngine on RewriteRule "^/here/(.*)" "http://example.com:8080/elsewhere?$1"; [P] ProxyPassReverse /here/ http://example.com:8080/ Request splitting/smuggling could result in bypass of access controls in the proxy server, proxying unintended URLs to existing origin servers, and cache poisoning. Users are recommended to update to at least version 2.4.56 of Apache HTTP Server. |
| CVE-2024-3566 | A command inject vulnerability allows an attacker to perform command injection on Windows applications that indirectly depend on the CreateProcess function when the specific conditions are satisfied. |
| CVE-2024-38474 | Substitution encoding issue in mod_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows attacker to execute scripts in directories permitted by the configuration but not directly reachable by any URL or source disclosure of scripts meant to only to be executed as CGI. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.60, which fixes this issue. Some RewriteRules that capture and substitute unsafely will now fail unless rewrite flag "UnsafeAllow3F" is specified. |
| CVE-2024-38476 | Vulnerability in core of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier are vulnerably to information disclosure, SSRF or local script execution via backend applications whose response headers are malicious or exploitable. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.60, which fixes this issue. |
| CVE-2015-8866 | ext/libxml/libxml.c in PHP before 5.5.22 and 5.6.x before 5.6.6, when PHP-FPM is used, does not isolate each thread from libxml_disable_entity_loader changes in other threads, which allows remote attackers to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) and XML Entity Expansion (XEE) attacks via a crafted XML document, a related issue to CVE-2015-5161. |
| CVE-2016-1903 | The gdImageRotateInterpolated function in ext/gd/libgd/gd_interpolation.c in PHP before 5.5.31, 5.6.x before 5.6.17, and 7.x before 7.0.2 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a large bgd_color argument to the imagerotate function. |

| CVE-2016-5116 | gd_xbm.c in the GD Graphics Library (aka libgd) before 2.2.0, as used in certain custom PHP 5.5.x configurations, allows context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory or cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer under-read and application crash) via a long name. |
| CVE-2017-9788 | In Apache httpd before 2.2.34 and 2.4.x before 2.4.27, the value placeholder in [Proxy-]Authorization headers of type 'Digest' was not initialized or reset before or between successive key=value assignments by mod_auth_digest. Providing an initial key with no '=' assignment could reflect the stale value of uninitialized pool memory used by the prior request, leading to leakage of potentially confidential information, and a segfault in other cases resulting in denial of service. |
| CVE-2017-11147 | In PHP before 5.6.30 and 7.x before 7.0.15, the PHAR archive handler could be used by attackers supplying malicious archive files to crash the PHP interpreter or potentially disclose information due to a buffer over-read in the phar_parse_pharfile function in ext/phar/phar.c. |
| CVE-2022-22721 | If LimitXMLRequestBody is set to allow request bodies larger than 350MB (defaults to 1M) on 32 bit systems an integer overflow happens which later causes out of bounds writes. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.52 and earlier. |
| CVE-2022-28615 | Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may crash or disclose information due to a read beyond bounds in ap_strcmp_match() when provided with an extremely large input buffer. While no code distributed with the server can be coerced into such a call, third-party modules or lua scripts that use ap_strcmp_match() may hypothetically be affected. |
| CVE-2024-38475 | Improper escaping of output in mod_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows an attacker to map URLs to filesystem locations that are permitted to be served by the server but are not intentionally/directly reachable by any URL, resulting in code execution or source code disclosure. Substitutions in server context that use a backreferences or variables as the first segment of the substitution are affected.  Some unsafe RewiteRules will be broken by this change and the rewrite flag "UnsafePrefixStat" can be used to opt back in once ensuring the substitution is appropriately constrained. |
| CVE-2021-40438 | A crafted request uri-path can cause mod_proxy to forward the request to an origin server choosen by the remote user. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.48 and earlier. |
| CVE-2022-36760 | Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling') vulnerability in mod_proxy_ajp of Apache HTTP Server allows an attacker to smuggle requests to the AJP server it forwards requests to. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server Apache HTTP Server 2.4 version 2.4.54 and prior versions. |

| CVE-2015-8873 | Stack consumption vulnerability in Zend/zend_exceptions.c in PHP before 5.4.44, 5.5.x before 5.5.28, and 5.6.x before 5.6.12 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via recursive method calls. |
| CVE-2015-8874 | Stack consumption vulnerability in GD in PHP before 5.6.12 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted imagefilltoborder call. |
| CVE-2015-8877 | The gdImageScaleTwoPass function in gd_interpolation.c in the GD Graphics Library (aka libgd) before 2.2.0, as used in PHP before 5.6.12, uses inconsistent allocate and free approaches, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted call, as demonstrated by a call to the PHP imagescale function. |
| CVE-2015-8879 | The odbc_bindcols function in ext/odbc/php_odbc.c in PHP before 5.6.12 mishandles driver behavior for SQL_WVARCHAR columns, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging use of the odbc_fetch_array function to access a certain type of Microsoft SQL Server table. |
| CVE-2015-8994 | An issue was discovered in PHP 5.x and 7.x, when the configuration uses apache2handler/mod_php or php-fpm with OpCache enabled. With 5.x after 5.6.28 or 7.x after 7.0.13, the issue is resolved in a non-default configuration with the opcache.validate_permission=1 setting. The vulnerability details are as follows. In PHP SAPIs where PHP interpreters share a common parent process, Zend OpCache creates a shared memory object owned by the common parent during initialization. Child PHP processes inherit the SHM descriptor, using it to cache and retrieve compiled script bytecode ("opcode" in PHP jargon). Cache keys vary depending on configuration, but filename is a central key component, and compiled opcode can generally be run if a script's filename is known or can be guessed. Many common shared-hosting configurations change EUID in child processes to enforce privilege separation among hosted users (for example using mod_ruid2 for the Apache HTTP Server, or php-fpm user settings). In these scenarios, the default Zend OpCache behavior defeats script file permissions by sharing a single SHM cache among all child PHP processes. PHP scripts often contain sensitive information: Think of CMS configurations where reading or running another user's script usually means gaining privileges to the CMS database. |
| CVE-2016-0736 | In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.23, mod_session_crypto was encrypting its data/cookie using the configured ciphers with possibly either CBC or ECB modes of operation (AES256-CBC by default), hence no selectable or builtin authenticated encryption. This made it vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, particularly with CBC. |
| CVE-2016-2161 | In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.23, malicious input to mod_auth_digest can cause the server to crash, and each instance continues to crash even for subsequently valid requests. |
| CVE-2016-4070 | Integer overflow in the php_raw_url_encode function in ext/standard/url.c in PHP before 5.5.34, 5.6.x before 5.6.20, and 7.x before 7.0.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a long string to the rawurlencode function. NOTE: the vendor says "Not sure if this qualifies as security issue (probably not). |
| CVE-2016-7125 | ext/session/session.c in PHP before 5.6.25 and 7.x before 7.0.10 skips invalid session names in a way that triggers incorrect parsing, which allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary-type session data by leveraging control of a session name, as demonstrated by object injection. |
| CVE-2016-7130 | The php_wddx_pop_element function in ext/wddx/wddx.c in PHP before 5.6.25 and 7.x before 7.0.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via an invalid base64 binary value, as demonstrated by a wddx_deserialize call that mishandles a binary element in a wddxPacket XML document. |
| CVE-2016-7131 | ext/wddx/wddx.c in PHP before 5.6.25 and 7.x before 7.0.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a malformed wddxPacket XML document that is mishandled in a wddx_deserialize call, as demonstrated by a tag that lacks a < (less than) character. |
| CVE-2016-7132 | ext/wddx/wddx.c in PHP before 5.6.25 and 7.x before 7.0.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via an invalid wddxPacket XML document that is mishandled in a wddx_deserialize call, as demonstrated by a stray element inside a boolean element, leading to incorrect pop processing. |
| CVE-2016-7416 | ext/intl/msgformat/msgformat_format.c in PHP before 5.6.26 and 7.x before 7.0.11 does not properly restrict the locale length provided to the Locale class in the ICU library, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a MessageFormatter::formatMessage call with a long first argument. |
| CVE-2016-7418 | The php_wddx_push_element function in ext/wddx/wddx.c in PHP before 5.6.26 and 7.x before 7.0.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid pointer access and out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via an incorrect boolean element in a wddxPacket XML document, leading to mishandling in a wddx_deserialize call. |
| CVE-2016-7478 | Zend/zend_exceptions.c in PHP, possibly 5.x before 5.6.28 and 7.x before 7.0.13, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a crafted Exception object in serialized data, a related issue to CVE-2015-8876. |
| CVE-2016-8743 | Apache HTTP Server, in all releases prior to 2.2.32 and 2.4.25, was liberal in the whitespace accepted from requests and sent in response lines and headers. Accepting these different behaviors represented a security concern when httpd participates in any chain of proxies or interacts with back-end application servers, either through mod_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms, and may result in request smuggling, response splitting and cache pollution. |
| CVE-2016-9933 | Stack consumption vulnerability in the gdImageFillToBorder function in gd.c in the GD Graphics Library (aka libgd) before 2.2.2, as used in PHP before 5.6.28 and 7.x before 7.0.13, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation violation) via a crafted imagefilltoborder call that triggers use of a negative color value. |
| CVE-2016-9934 | ext/wddx/wddx.c in PHP before 5.6.28 and 7.x before 7.0.13 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via crafted serialized data in a wddxPacket XML document, as demonstrated by a PDORow string. |
| CVE-2016-10158 | The exif_convert_any_to_int function in ext/exif/exif.c in PHP before 5.6.30, 7.0.x before 7.0.15, and 7.1.x before 7.1.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via crafted EXIF data that triggers an attempt to divide the minimum representable negative integer by -1. |
| CVE-2016-10159 | Integer overflow in the phar_parse_pharfile function in ext/phar/phar.c in PHP before 5.6.30 and 7.0.x before 7.0.15 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or application crash) via a truncated manifest entry in a PHAR archive. |
| CVE-2016-10161 | The object_common1 function in ext/standard/var_unserializer.c in PHP before 5.6.30, 7.0.x before 7.0.15, and 7.1.x before 7.1.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read and application crash) via crafted serialized data that is mishandled in a finish_nested_data call. |
| CVE-2016-10397 | In PHP before 5.6.28 and 7.x before 7.0.13, incorrect handling of various URI components in the URL parser could be used by attackers to bypass hostname-specific URL checks, as demonstrated by evil.example.com:80#@good.example.com/ and evil.example.com:80?@good.example.com/ inputs to the parse_url function (implemented in the php_url_parse_ex function in ext/standard/url.c). |
| CVE-2016-10712 | In PHP before 5.5.32, 5.6.x before 5.6.18, and 7.x before 7.0.3, all of the return values of stream_get_meta_data can be controlled if the input can be controlled (e.g., during file uploads). For example, a "$uri = stream_get_meta_data(fopen($file, "r"))['uri']" call mishandles the case where $file is data:text/plain;uri=eviluri, -- in other words, metadata can be set by an attacker. |
| CVE-2017-7963 | The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP) interfaces for PHP through 7.1.4 allow attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and application crash) via operations on long strings. NOTE: the vendor disputes this, stating "There is no security issue here, because GMP safely aborts in case of an OOM condition. The only attack vector here is denial of service. However, if you allow attacker-controlled, unbounded allocations you have a DoS vector regardless of GMP's OOM behavior. |
| CVE-2017-9798 | Apache httpd allows remote attackers to read secret data from process memory if the Limit directive can be set in a user's .htaccess file, or if httpd.conf has certain misconfigurations, aka Optionsbleed. This affects the Apache HTTP Server through 2.2.34 and 2.4.x through 2.4.27. The attacker sends an unauthenticated OPTIONS HTTP request when attempting to read secret data. This is a use-after-free issue and thus secret data is not always sent, and the specific data depends on many factors including configuration. Exploitation with .htaccess can be blocked with a patch to the ap_limit_section function in server/core.c. |
| CVE-2017-11142 | In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.17, and 7.1.x before 7.1.3, remote attackers could cause a CPU consumption denial of service attack by injecting long form variables, related to main/php_variables.c. |
| CVE-2017-11143 | In PHP before 5.6.31, an invalid free in the WDDX deserialization of boolean parameters could be used by attackers able to inject XML for deserialization to crash the PHP interpreter, related to an invalid free for an empty boolean element in ext/wddx/wddx.c. |
| CVE-2017-11144 | In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, the openssl extension PEM sealing code did not check the return value of the OpenSSL sealing function, which could lead to a crash of the PHP interpreter, related to an interpretation conflict for a negative number in ext/openssl/openssl.c, and an OpenSSL documentation omission. |
| CVE-2017-11145 | In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.21, and 7.1.x before 7.1.7, an error in the date extension's timelib_meridian parsing code could be used by attackers able to supply date strings to leak information from the interpreter, related to ext/date/lib/parse_date.c out-of-bounds reads affecting the php_parse_date function. NOTE: the correct fix is in the e8b7698f5ee757ce2c8bd10a192a491a498f891c commit, not the bd77ac90d3bdf31ce2a5251ad92e9e75 gist. |
| CVE-2017-15710 | In Apache httpd 2.0.23 to 2.0.65, 2.2.0 to 2.2.34, and 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, mod_authnz_ldap, if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the Accept-Language header value to lookup the right charset encoding when verifying the user's credentials. If the header value is not present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it to a two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is truncated to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an out of bound write of one NUL byte to a memory location that is not part of the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process would crash which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case, this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect at all. |
| CVE-2017-16642 | In PHP before 5.6.32, 7.x before 7.0.25, and 7.1.x before 7.1.11, an error in the date extension's timelib_meridian handling of 'front of' and 'back of' directives could be used by attackers able to supply date strings to leak information from the interpreter, related to ext/date/lib/parse_date.c out-of-bounds reads affecting the php_parse_date function. NOTE: this is a different issue than CVE-2017-11145. |
| CVE-2018-1303 | A specially crafted HTTP request header could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.30 due to an out of bound read while preparing data to be cached in shared memory. It could be used as a Denial of Service attack against users of mod_cache_socache. The vulnerability is considered as low risk since mod_cache_socache is not widely used, mod_cache_disk is not concerned by this vulnerability. |
| CVE-2018-10546 | An issue was discovered in PHP before 5.6.36, 7.0.x before 7.0.30, 7.1.x before 7.1.17, and 7.2.x before 7.2.5. An infinite loop exists in ext/iconv/iconv.c because the iconv stream filter does not reject invalid multibyte sequences. |
| CVE-2018-10548 | An issue was discovered in PHP before 5.6.36, 7.0.x before 7.0.30, 7.1.x before 7.1.17, and 7.2.x before 7.2.5. ext/ldap/ldap.c allows remote LDAP servers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) because of mishandling of the ldap_get_dn return value. |

| CVE-2018-15132 | An issue was discovered in ext/standard/link_win32.c in PHP before 5.6.37, 7.0.x before 7.0.31, 7.1.x before 7.1.20, and 7.2.x before 7.2.8. The linkinfo function on Windows doesn't implement the open_basedir check. This could be abused to find files on paths outside of the allowed directories. |
| CVE-2018-17199 | In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 release 2.4.37 and prior, mod_session checks the session expiry time before decoding the session. This causes session expiry time to be ignored for mod_session_cookie sessions since the expiry time is loaded when the session is decoded. |
| CVE-2018-19395 | ext/standard/var.c in PHP 5.x through 7.1.24 on Windows allows attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) because com and com_safearray_proxy return NULL in com_properties_get in ext/com_dotnet/com_handlers.c, as demonstrated by a serialize call on COM("WScript.Shell"). |
| CVE-2018-19396 | ext/standard/var_unserializer.c in PHP 5.x through 7.1.24 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via an unserialize call for the com, dotnet, or variant class. |
| CVE-2018-20783 | In PHP before 5.6.39, 7.x before 7.0.33, 7.1.x before 7.1.25, and 7.2.x before 7.2.13, a buffer over-read in PHAR reading functions may allow an attacker to read allocated or unallocated memory past the actual data when trying to parse a .phar file. This is related to phar_parse_pharfile in ext/phar/phar.c. |
| CVE-2019-0217 | In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 release 2.4.38 and prior, a race condition in mod_auth_digest when running in a threaded server could allow a user with valid credentials to authenticate using another username, bypassing configured access control restrictions. |
| CVE-2019-9024 | An issue was discovered in PHP before 5.6.40, 7.x before 7.1.26, 7.2.x before 7.2.14, and 7.3.x before 7.3.1. xmlrpc_decode() can allow a hostile XMLRPC server to cause PHP to read memory outside of allocated areas in base64_decode_xmlrpc in ext/xmlrpc/libxmlrpc/base64.c. |
| CVE-2019-9637 | An issue was discovered in PHP before 7.1.27, 7.2.x before 7.2.16, and 7.3.x before 7.3.3. Due to the way rename() across filesystems is implemented, it is possible that file being renamed is briefly available with wrong permissions while the rename is ongoing, thus enabling unauthorized users to access the data. |
| CVE-2019-9638 | An issue was discovered in the EXIF component in PHP before 7.1.27, 7.2.x before 7.2.16, and 7.3.x before 7.3.3. There is an uninitialized read in exif_process_IFD_in_MAKERNOTE because of mishandling the maker_note->offset relationship to value_len. |

| CVE-2024-42516 | HTTP response splitting in the core of Apache HTTP Server allows an attacker who can manipulate the Content-Type response headers of applications hosted or proxied by the server can split the HTTP response. This vulnerability was described as CVE-2023-38709 but the patch included in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 did not address the issue. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.64, which fixes this issue. |
| CVE-2024-43204 | SSRF in Apache HTTP Server with mod_proxy loaded allows an attacker to send outbound proxy requests to a URL controlled by the attacker.  Requires an unlikely configuration where mod_headers is configured to modify the Content-Type request or response header with a value provided in the HTTP request. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.64 which fixes this issue. |
| CVE-2024-43394 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Apache HTTP Server on Windows allows to potentially leak NTLM hashes to a malicious server via  mod_rewrite or apache expressions that pass unvalidated request input. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.0 through 2.4.63. Note:  The Apache HTTP Server Project will be setting a higher bar for accepting vulnerability reports regarding SSRF via UNC paths. The server offers limited protection against administrators directing the server to open UNC paths. Windows servers should limit the hosts they will connect over via SMB based on the nature of NTLM authentication. |
| CVE-2024-47252 | Insufficient escaping of user-supplied data in mod_ssl in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.63 and earlier allows an untrusted SSL/TLS client to insert escape characters into log files in some configurations. In a logging configuration where CustomLog is used with "%{varname}x" or "%{varname}c" to log variables provided by mod_ssl such as SSL_TLS_SNI, no escaping is performed by either mod_log_config or mod_ssl and unsanitized data provided by the client may appear in log files. |
| CVE-2017-7272 | PHP through 7.1.11 enables potential SSRF in applications that accept an fsockopen or pfsockopen hostname argument with an expectation that the port number is constrained. Because a :port syntax is recognized, fsockopen will use the port number that is specified in the hostname argument, instead of the port number in the second argument of the function. |
| CVE-2025-49812 | In some mod_ssl configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions through to 2.4.63, an HTTP desynchronisation attack allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to hijack an HTTP session via a TLS upgrade. Only configurations using "SSLEngine optional" to enable TLS upgrades are affected. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.64, which removes support for TLS upgrade. |
| CVE-2014-9426 | The apprentice_load function in libmagic/apprentice.c in the Fileinfo component in PHP through 5.6.4 attempts to perform a free operation on a stack-based character array, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or application crash) via unknown vectors. NOTE: this is disputed by the vendor because the standard erealloc behavior makes the free operation unreachable |
| CVE-2015-5590 | Stack-based buffer overflow in the phar_fix_filepath function in ext/phar/phar.c in PHP before 5.4.43, 5.5.x before 5.5.27, and 5.6.x before 5.6.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a large length value, as demonstrated by mishandling of an e-mail attachment by the imap PHP extension. |
| CVE-2015-6831 | Multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities in SPL in PHP before 5.4.44, 5.5.x before 5.5.28, and 5.6.x before 5.6.12 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors involving (1) ArrayObject, (2) SplObjectStorage, and (3) SplDoublyLinkedList, which are mishandled during unserialization. |
| CVE-2015-6832 | Use-after-free vulnerability in the SPL unserialize implementation in ext/spl/spl_array.c in PHP before 5.4.44, 5.5.x before 5.5.28, and 5.6.x before 5.6.12 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted serialized data that triggers misuse of an array field. |
| CVE-2015-6836 | The SoapClient __call method in ext/soap/soap.c in PHP before 5.4.45, 5.5.x before 5.5.29, and 5.6.x before 5.6.13 does not properly manage headers, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted serialized data that triggers a "type confusion" in the serialize_function_call function. |
| CVE-2015-8387 | PCRE before 8.38 mishandles (?123) subroutine calls and related subroutine calls, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted regular expression, as demonstrated by a JavaScript RegExp object encountered by Konqueror. |
| CVE-2015-8865 | The file_check_mem function in funcs.c in file before 5.23, as used in the Fileinfo component in PHP before 5.5.34, 5.6.x before 5.6.20, and 7.x before 7.0.5, mishandles continuation-level jumps, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted magic file. |
| CVE-2020-35452 | Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.46 A specially crafted Digest nonce can cause a stack overflow in mod_auth_digest. There is no report of this overflow being exploitable, nor the Apache HTTP Server team could create one, though some particular compiler and/or compilation option might make it possible, with limited consequences anyway due to the size (a single byte) and the value (zero byte) of the overflow |
| CVE-2023-38709 | Faulty input validation in the core of Apache allows malicious or exploitable backend/content generators to split HTTP responses. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: through 2.4.58. |
| CVE-2014-0185 | sapi/fpm/fpm/fpm_unix.c in the FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) in PHP before 5.4.28 and 5.5.x before 5.5.12 uses 0666 permissions for the UNIX socket, which allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted FastCGI client. |
| CVE-2016-3185 | The make_http_soap_request function in ext/soap/php_http.c in PHP before 5.4.44, 5.5.x before 5.5.28, 5.6.x before 5.6.12, and 7.x before 7.0.4 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory or cause a denial of service (type confusion and application crash) via crafted serialized _cookies data, related to the SoapClient::__call method in ext/soap/soap.c. |
| CVE-2006-20001 | A carefully crafted If: request header can cause a memory read, or write of a single zero byte, in a pool (heap) memory location beyond the header value sent. This could cause the process to crash. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.54 and earlier. |
